def molecular_role_distribution(graph):
    """
    Function that computes a donor-acceptor profile for each water molecule.
    It accepts a graph with hydrogen and oxygen atoms as nodes, and returns
    two dictionaries.
    The first dictionary provides molecule-level role description. Keys in
    the dictionary correspond to the oxygen atom ids in each water molecule.
    The values are the corresponding donor-acceptor roles aggregated from the
    hydrogen and oxygen atoms in that molecule.  Profiles such as
    donor-acceptor-donor or donor-donor-acceptor are both represented as a1d2.
    The second dictionary is a Counter that aggregates the counts from
    the distribution stored in the first dictionary.
    Example: Counter({'a2d2': 12, 'a1d2': 9, 'a2d1': 8, 'a3d2': 1})
